## Backend (Convex)

Convex functions live in `backend/`. As the app grows:

- **Schemas** — `backend/schemas/` per domain; compose in `backend/schema.ts` only.
- **Routes** — `backend/routes/<feature>/` (e.g. `auth/`, `templates/`, `workouts/`) for queries, mutations, and actions. Avoid dumping new function files at `backend/` root.

See `.cursor/rules/backend-organization.mdc` for full conventions.
